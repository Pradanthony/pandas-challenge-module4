Module 4 Assignment on Pandas
This was a challenging and interesting assignment on the analysis of schools performance.

Grouping, binning and specially formatting was a challenge!

The analysis of school performance was taken by measuring the percentage of students in each schools with more than 70%(pass mark) in math, reading and overall score. Analysis of the performances of each grades (9 to 12) and the school sorted by top and bottom performers.
Further analysis was performed to investiagte the impact of the school budget per student, school size by population and school type.

This detailed analysis reveals that the school budget per student does not have a positive impact on the school performance but in contrary the school performance lowered with an increase in budget per student. The low budegt per student schools out-performed the high budget per student by a margin of 90% to 53%.

Interms of the school size, small and medium sized schools performed better than the large schools (over 2000 students) by a big margin of 90% to 58%.
finally Charter schools out-performed District schools by 90% and 53% respectively.
In conclusion, the school size and school type have an impact on the performance of the schools with small and medium schools and Charter schools performing way better. However school budget per student does not have a positive impact on the school performance.
